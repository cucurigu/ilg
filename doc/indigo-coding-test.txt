# An API for Asian Cities

Write a JSON API with a single endpoint `/` that returns a list of Asia's largest cities. The API must use Wikipedia as a data source, returning the list of cities found on the page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_Asia. It is expected to get this information in real time, and change as Wikipedia changes.

The API will return a JSON array of city descriptions, each city containing the following fields:

* `name` the city name
* `country` the name of the country
* `population` the city's population
* `url` the URL to the city's page on Wikipedia

For e.g.

```json
{
  "name": "Shanghai",
  "country": "China",
  "population": 23390000,
  "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"
}
```

A typical `curl` interaction might look like this:

```
> curl http://localhost:4000/
[
  {
    "name": "Tokyo",
    "country": "Japan",
    "population": 39800000,
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area"
  },
  {
    "name": "Jakarta",
    "country": "Indonesia",
    "population": 28900000,
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"
  },
  ...
]
```

## For Bonus Points

Add the city's description as found in the first paragraph on the city's Wikipedia page, in the `description` field.

For example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Tokyo",
    "country": "Japan",
    "population": 39800000,
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area",
    "description": "The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, consisting of the Kantō region of Japan, including the Tokyo Metropolis, as well as the prefecture of Yamanashi of the neighboring Chūbu region. In Japanese, it is referred to by various terms, one of the most common being National Capital Region (首都圏, Shuto-ken)."

  {
    "name": "Jakarta",
    "country": "Indonesia",
    "population": 28900000,
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta",
    "description": "Jakarta (/dʒəˈkɑːrtə/; Indonesian pronunciation: [dʒaˈkarta]), officially the Special Capital Region of Jakarta (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus Ibu Kota Jakarta), is the capital and largest city of Indonesia.
